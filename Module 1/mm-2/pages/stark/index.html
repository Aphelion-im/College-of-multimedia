      <p><strong><a href="index.html">House Stark</a> of Winterfell</strong> is a Great House of Westeros and the royal
        house of the Kingdom of
        the
        North. They rule over the vast region known as the North from their seat in Winterfell. It is one of the
        oldest
        lines of Westerosi nobility by far, claiming a line of descent stretching back over eight thousand years.
        Before
        the Targaryen conquest, as well as during the War of the Five Kings and early on in <a
          href="../../pages/targaryen/daenerys-targaryen.html">Daenerys Targaryen's</a> war
        for
        Westeros, the leaders of House Stark ruled over the region as the Kings in the North.</p>
      <p>
        Their rule in the North seemingly ended after the events of the Red Wedding when House Frey and House Bolton
        betrayed House Stark after forming a secret alliance with <a href="../../pages/lannister/index.html">House
          Lannister</a>, during which Roose Bolton murdered
        King Robb Stark. Both the North and Winterfell were taken over by House Bolton. However, the Boltons' hold was
        jeopardized when <a href="../../pages/stark/sansa-stark.html">Sansa Stark</a> escaped their clutches after
        learning
        her brothers Bran and Rickon Stark were
        still alive and reunited with her half-brother, <a href="../../pages/stark/jon-snow.html">Jon Snow</a>, at
        Castle
        Black. Sansa and Jon marched on the Boltons to
        save their younger brother Rickon, who was later murdered by Ramsay Bolton, and retake Winterfell.</p>
      <h3>Battle of the Bastards</h3>
      <p>
        House Stark was restored to their former stature after the Battle of the Bastards. The Stark victory led to
        House Stark's
        return to royal status in the North with their bannermen declaring Jon as the King in the North.
        He later abdicated his title as king in order to gain the full support of Daenerys Targaryen in the Great War,
        becoming the Warden of the North.</p>

      <p>
        Following the Battle of King's Landing, Bran Stark was chosen as the new king of the
        Six Kingdoms, allowing the North to secede as an independent kingdom under Sansa.
        House Stark's sigil is a grey direwolf on a white background, over a green escutcheon. They are one of the few
        noble Houses whose family motto is not a boast or threat. Instead, the House Stark family motto is a warning,
        one that, no matter the circumstances, will always be relevant: "Winter Is Coming."</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>
        Before the Targaryen conquest, the leaders of House Stark ruled over the region as the Kings in the North.The
        house traces its roots to Bran the Builder, a legendary First Man who lived during the Age of Heroes and founded
        House Stark.</p>
      <p>
        The Starks ruled as Kings of Winter over one of the many smaller, petty First Men kingdoms that were established
        in the North, with their chief rivals for domination being the Red Kings of House Bolton. Eventually the Starks
        united the North under them. They defeated the Boltons, drove pirates away from the White Knife, slew the last
        Marsh King and wed his daughter for the Neck, and, according to legend, King Rodrik Stark wrestled with an
        ironborn for Bear Island and won.</p>
      <p>
        Several centuries before the Targaryen conquest, Karlon Stark, a younger son of the King in the North, was
        awarded lands in the eastern regions of the North after successfully putting down a rebellion led by House
        Bolton. Over time Karlon's seat of Karl's Hold came to be known as Karhold, and the Starks that descended from
        him became known as Karstarks.</p>

      <p>
        King Torrhen Stark was on the throne at the time of the Targaryen conquest and marched his army south to face
        them. He surrendered when he saw the Targaryens' greater host and their dragons, believing that fighting was
        futile.</p>
      <p>
        He was made Lord Paramount of the North and served the Targaryens as Warden of the North, thus escaping the
        fates of House Gardener of the Reach and House Hoare of the Riverlands whose lords refused to bend the knee and
        were rendered extinct after failing to resist the invaders. Thereafter, Torrhen was known as "the king who
        knelt", though those who criticize him for this often forget that they are only alive to do so thanks to his
        surrender.</p>
